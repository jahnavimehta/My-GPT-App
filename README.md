## Project Description

My GPT App is an Android application that leverages the power of the OpenAI GPT-3 language model to provide users with 
natural language processing capabilities. The app allows users to enter questions or prompts, and it will generate responses 
based on the GPT-3 model's understanding of the input. It can be used for a wide range of tasks, including generating text, answering questions, 
completing sentences, and more.
